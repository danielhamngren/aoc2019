#AOC2019

Here are my solutions to Advent of Code 2019, https://adventofcode.com/2019/

I've used these problems to learn to code in Rust. Hopefully the later solutions are nicer and more idiomatic rust than the first ones.

# Running the solution

Edit the src/main.rs to select the days you are interested in.

Run and build by enter `cargo run` in the terminal. (Assuming you have rust and cargo installed on your system).
